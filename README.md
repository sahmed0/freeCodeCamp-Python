This repository serves as a portfolio of my solutions for the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** certification. It contains five distinct projects that demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualisation using the Python scientific stack.

## 📂 Project Overview

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**1. Mean-Variance-Std Calculator**](./Mean-Var-Calc) | A custom function that takes a list of digits and outputs a dictionary of statistical calculations (mean, variance, std, etc.) for a 3x3 matrix. | `Numpy` |
| [**2. Demographic Data Analyzer**](./Demographic-Data-Analyser) | An analysis of the 1994 Census database to extract insights regarding age, education, and salary correlations. | `Pandas` |
| [**3. Medical Data Visualizer**](./Medical-Data-Visualiser) | A data visualisation project exploring the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, and lifestyle choices. | `Seaborn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` |
| [**4. Page View Time Series Visualizer**](./Time-Series-Visualiser) | Visualisation of forum page view data to identify year-over-year trends and seasonal patterns using line, bar, and box plots. | `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` |
| [**5. Sea Level Predictor**](./Sea-Level-Predictor) | A linear regression model that uses historical data to predict global average sea level rise through the year 2050. | `Scipy`, `Matplotlib` |

## 🚀 How to Run

Each project is contained within its own directory. To run a specific project:

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/data-analysis-portfolio.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/data-analysis-portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd 01-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
    ```
3.  Follow the instructions in that folder's `README.md`.
